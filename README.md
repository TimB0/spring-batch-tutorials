Spring Batch tutorials, covering all the aspects and methods of this wonderful Java framework.

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to Spring Batch tutorials for new and advanced users alike.

The tutorials will provide you with step-by-step guides for using Spring Batch and some background informations for the concepts. If you are ready to get more, head over to my [Spring Batch Examples][spring-batch-examples], [Templates][spring-batch-templates] and [Maven Archetypes][spring-batch-archetypes] here at github too.

If you want to see a new tutorial or spot an error, do not hesitate to [raise an issue][issue]. For questions to the Spring Batch framework itself, i suggest to ask at [Stackoverflow][stackoverflow] or the official [Spring Batch Forum][spring-batch-forum] (i'm active at both).

## Tutorial Topics

* The inevitable [Hello World!][hello-world-java]
* A more exotic [Hello World!][hello-world-groovy] with [Groovy][groovy]

## General Informations

All Spring Batch Tutorials:

* are individual maven projects, the pom.xml in the root directory is only for a convenient _build all_ feature
* are tested with:
  * Spring Batch 2.1.8.RELEASE
  * Spring Framework 3.1.0.RELEASE
* are provided "as is", no guarantees

## About Me

I am [Michael R. Lange][homepage] from Germany and would describe myself as a [Code Craftsman][code-craftsman].

My motivation to write the tutorials comes from the usage at work and at home too, so it was about time to write and share some of the knowledge i picked up around.
